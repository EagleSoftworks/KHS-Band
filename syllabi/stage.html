<h4 class="center">Rehearsals</h4>
<p>
    Thursday nights from 5 -7 pm
</p>

<br>
<h4 class="center">Attendance Policy</h4>
<p>
    Participation in Concert Band or Drumline is a co-requisite of this class. Stage Band is alternatively scheduled, advanced level class. This means that rehearsals are treated like classes that meet during the school day. Students need to have 2 feet in the band room by 5:00 pm sharp. Class will be excused at 7:00 pm. Consensus will be reached by the entire band if we need to change the class meeting time due to student conflicts. This sometimes happens during changes of sports seasons. Students are excused for sports contests just as they are during the regular school day. If you get sick, please stay home to get better and so everyone else will stay healthy. If you are sick during the regular school day and are feeling better by Jazz Band time, you may come in for class.
</p>
<p>
    The absence of one member adversely affects the performance experience of the other students. All members should attend class regularly and clear their schedules for performances. School related conflicts: These will be handled on an individual basis with the advisor of the activity, Dr. Davison, the student, and the parents.
</p>
<p>Membership in the Jazz Band brings with it expectations for and of each student. These include: </p>
<ol class="sublist">
    <li>Mastery of assigned literature.</li>
    <li>Satisfactory playing grades and practice results.</li>
    <li>Acceptable behavior and esprit de corps.</li>
    <li>Attendance at rehearsals, performances, lessons, etc.</li>
</ol>

<br>
<h4 class="center">Performances</h4>
<p>
    Performances are required activities and represent the cumulative efforts of individuals and the whole group.  They serve as Summative Assessments in the grading system.  Excuses for missing a performance are death in the family or severe illness. Dr. Davison should be notified before the performance if possible. 
</p>
<p>
    Occasionally, extenuating circumstances need to be considered. If you believe you need to be absent, please submit a written statement to the director two weeks prior to the absence. This will be considered and the student can be notified if the absence is to remain unexcused. Unexcused absence examples include, but are not limited to, work, babysitting, trips, outings, dances, dates, oversleeping, forgetfulness, and transportation issues (I suggest carpooling). An unexcused absence from a performance will result in the final grade being lowered by one letter grade.
</p>

<br>
<h4 class="center">Avoiding Conflict</h4>
<p>
    Work is not an excused absence from performances or from class. Give your employers a complete jazz band schedule. Highlight the problems that you foresee. Many employers hire band students because they often demonstrate responsibility and reliability.  You can avoid unnecessary stress by noticing possible conflicts well in advance and taking action to find a solution. If a conflict does exist, please see Mrs. Davison at least 48 hours in advance so any needed changes in the class agenda can be made.
</p>

<br>
<h4 class="center">Uniforms</h4>
