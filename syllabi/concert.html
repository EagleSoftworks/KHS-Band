    <h1>Welcome to Band!</h1>
    <p class="italics">A band is not proud because it is great. It is great because it is proud. ~ George N. Parks</p>
    <p>The KHS band program has a proud tradition and is well respected both locally and across the state.</p>
    <p>We want everybody to have a GREAT time while learning more on their instruments!</p>
    <p>With that in mind...</p>
</div>

<br>
<h4>Social Media</h4>
<p class="italics center">"Think once before you act, twice before you speak, and three times before you post on Facebook."</p>
<p>Band members are expected to be respectful of each other both inside and outside of class. Therefore, ONLY POSITIVE COMMENTS about the band, music students, or the staff can be posted on social media. If you have concerns or complaints, please make an appointment to speak with Dr. Davison. All concerns will be handled professionally and with improvement in mind. If we don't know there is a problem, we can't make the situation better.</p>

<br>
<h4>Back to School Clothes</h4>
<p>
	Please be sure your son or daughter owns a white, button-down dress shirt (long or short sleeve), black crew-length socks, and ALL black shoes or sneakers. Students will use these for every full uniform performance. Students will also receive an order form for the required pep band shirts. Please contact Dr. Davison if you are unable to afford these items and confidential arrangements will be made to provide them.
</p>

<br>
<h4>Equipment</h4>
<p>
	Every band member is responsible for the proper care and use of KHS property. Students should only play or touch their own instruments or instruments that have been assigned to them. Only percussionists may play on percussion equipment. Students provide their own accessories for their instruments, i.e., reeds swabs, valve oil, mutes, etc. Drummers provide their own sticks. Please contact Dr. Davison if you are unable to afford these items and confidential arrangements will be made to provide them.
</p>

<br>
<h4>Loaner instruments</h4>
<p>
	Loaner instruments are available for a small fee. Students must complete a loaner contract before an instrument will be assigned. Instruments are loaned on a first come, first served basis and are available while supplies last.
</p>

<br>
<h4>Buying Instruments</h4>
<p>
	Quality musical instruments really do make a difference. There are a lot of pretty looking instruments out there that are substandard. If you are planning to buy an instrument, PLEASE contact Dr. Davison to help insure your money is well-spent.
</p>

<br>
<h4>Performances</h4>
<p>
	Concert Band performances are a group effort and therefore everyone must be present at all required performances. Performances are Common Assessments.
</p>

<br>
<h4>Excused Absences</h4>
<p class="center bold outline">Bring in a note from a parent or guardian at least 2 weeks in advance of the performance.</p>
<p class="bold">Excused absences include illness, death in the family, religious observance, or unavoidably scheduled family commitments, and emergencies.<span class="italics">Except for emergencies or illness, two weeks, advanced, written notice must be given by a PARENT OR GUARDIAN. In cases of emergency or illness, please provide a note on the first day back in school.</span>Students with an excused absence must complete a make-up assignment. A list of choices will be provided. Failure to complete the assignment will result in a 0 for the performance.</p>
<br>
<p><span class="bold">Unexcused absences</span> include but are not limited to transportation, work, babysitting, parties, dances, dates, haircuts, oversleeping, and forgetfulness. An unexcused absence will be averaged as a zero. Should a school related conflict arise, it will be handled on an individual basis with the advisor of the activity and Dr. Davison.</p>

<br>
<h4>Band and Sports</h4>
<p>
	We want students to participate in both. The Athletic and Music Department work closely to insure most performances and games do not conflict. Occasionally, students may need parents to drive them back to school after a game in time for performances. Dr. Davison will help coordinate carpools. On the rare occasion that students cannot do both, freshman and JV players are expected to be with the band. Varsity players can choose. Players who miss a performance due to a sport's conflict are expected to substitute another performance scheduled outside of their sports' seasons. Dr. Davison will work with students individually on this requirement.
