<h4>What is Unified Music?</h4>
<p>Unified Music is part of the General Music strand of the SAU 9 Music Curriculum. It first became part of the Program of Studies for the 2014-2015 school year. This means that students receive a variety of music experiences rather than focus on type of music group, such as band or chorus. This class hopes to integrate Job Prep students with students who are enrolled in regular education classes and thereby provide academic and social growth to everyone involved.</p>
