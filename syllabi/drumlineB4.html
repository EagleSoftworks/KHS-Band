    <h1>Welcome to Drumline!</h1>
    <p class="italics">A band is not proud because it is great. It is great because it is proud. ~ George N. Parks</p>
    <p>The KHS band program has a proud tradition and is well respected both locally and across the state.</p>
    <p>We want everybody to have a GREAT time while learning more on their instruments!</p>
    <p>With that in mind...</p>
</div>

<br>
<h4>Social Media</h4>
<p class="italics center">"Think once before you act, twice before you speak, and three times before you post on Facebook."</p>
<p>
    Drumline members are expected to be respectful of each other both inside and outside of class. Therefore, ONLY POSITIVE COMMENTS about the Drumline, band, music students, or the staff can be posted on social media. If you have concerns or complaints, please make an appointment to speak with Dr. Davison. All concerns will be handled professionally and with improvement in mind. If we don’t know of a problem, we can’t make it better.
</p>

<br>
<h4>Back to School Clothes</h4>
<p>
	Please be sure your son or daughter owns black dress pants (no yoga pants, please), black crew-length socks, and ALL black shoes or sneakers. Students will use these for every full uniform performance. Students will also receive an order form for the required pep band shirts after the school year gets going. Please contact Dr. Davison this creates a financial hardship and confidential arrangements will be made to provide them.
</p>

<br>
<h4>Equipment</h4>
<p>
    Every band member is responsible for the proper care and use of KHS property.  Students should only play or touch their own instruments or instruments that have been assigned to them. Drummers provide their own Vic Firth STH Thom Hannum Marching Snare Drumsticks.  These are available at the North Conway Music Center and on-line. Please contact Dr. Davison if you are unable to afford sticks and confidential arrangements will be made to provide them.
</p>

<br>
<h4>Part Assignment</h4>
<p>
    Students are assigned to parts based on ability and grade level. Competencies are leveled according to class standing (freshman, sophomore, juniors, and seniors).  Students may challenge each other to move to a new part.  Challenge procedures are available upon request. Every attempt is made to provide all students will experience on all percussion instruments at some point during the year.

</p>

<br>
<h4>Excused Absences</h4>
<p class="center bold outline">Bring in a note from a parent or guardian at least 2 weeks in advance of the performance.</p>
<p class="bold">Excused absences include illness, death in the family, religious observance, or unavoidably scheduled family commitments, and emergencies.<span class="italics">Except for emergencies or illness, two weeks, advanced, written notice must be given by a PARENT OR GUARDIAN. In cases of emergency or illness, please provide a note on the first day back in school.</span>Students with an excused absence must complete a make-up assignment. A list of choices will be provided. Failure to complete the assignment will result in a 0 for the performance.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Unexcused absences</span> include but are not limited to transportation, work, babysitting, parties, dances, dates, haircuts, oversleeping, and forgetfulness. An unexcused absence will be averaged as a zero. Should a school related conflict arise, it will be handled on an individual basis with the advisor of the activity and Dr. Davison.</p>

<br>
<h4>Drumline and Sports</h4>
<p>
    We want students to participate in both. The Athletic and Music Department work closely to insure most performances and games do not conflict. Occasionally, students may need parents to drive them back to school after a sports event in time for performances. Dr. Davison will help coordinate carpools. On the rare occasion that students cannot do both, Freshmen and JV players should perform with the band. Varsity players can choose. Players who miss a required performance due to a sport’s conflict are expected to substitute an optional performance scheduled outside of their sports seasons. Dr. Davison will work with students individually to fulfil this requirement.
</p>

<br>
<h4>Private Lessons</h4>
<p>
    Private lessons are strongly encouraged. Individual instruction is the most effective and efficient way to quickly gain added proficiency on your instrument. Please see Dr. Davison if you need a recommendation for a private teacher.
