<h4>Course Description</h4>
<p>Instrumental Music Workshop is an exciting opportunity to learn a new band instrument, play your violin, or improve current instrument skills in a more individualized setting when compared to Concert Band or KHS Drumline. Weekly practice assignments, written tests, and in-class performances serve as formative and common assessments. Students must be willing and able to practice at home. A limited number of school owned instruments are available. They will be assigned on a first come-first served basis. Rental instruments are available locally. This course is limited to 18 students.</p>

<br>
<h4>Class Expectations</h4>
<p>This class is different from other classes because the teacher does not tell the student what to work on (unless the student cannot create a project). Students create their own projects to meet the Key Learning Targets with guidance and approval from the teacher. Students must make progress on their music for Formative Assessment grades. Completed projects serve as Common Assessment grades.</p>
